If you have signed up for this class, you are most likely driven by curiosity and interested in how data decisions are made. Possibly, you have a more empathetic approach to how the world works and how problems can be solved. Finally, you have an eye for how society reports and uses data to make impactful decisions.1.\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to use data-driven programming in Python to handle, format, and visualize data. We will introduce you to data wrangling techniques, analytical methods, and the grammar of graphics. Specifically, as a successful learner, you will be able to;\n Use functions, data structures, and other programming constructs efficiently to process and find meaning in data. Programmatically load data from various types of data sources, including files, databases, and remote services. Use data manipulation libraries to perform straightforward analysis, produce charts, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms. Use machine learning libraries to discover insights, make predictions, and interpret the success of these algorithms. Use industry-leading tools to collaborate and share your work.  Principles of DS teaching The course follows these principles of teaching Data Science2\n Organize the course around a set of diverse projects Integrate computing into every aspect of the course Teach abstraction, but minimize reliance on mathematical notation Structure course activities to realistically mimic a data scientist\u0026rsquo;s experience Demonstrate the importance of critical thinking\/skepticism through examples  Competency assumptions This course focuses on programming with data to find insights. The prerequisite for this course is an introductory programming course in Python (CSE 110)3. We recommend taking CSE 111 before or during the same semester you take this course - especially if programming is complicated for you. We assume that you do know what the Terminal is and how to execute scripts.\nAn understanding of standard deviation{target=\u0026quot;blank\u0026rdquo;} and variance{target=\u0026quot;blank\u0026rdquo;} will be valuable.\nCourse materials and structure This course focuses on building core data science skills. You will learn to program, but you will also learn how to communicate and collaborate with your peers and mentors.\nCourse communication  How do I talk with my teacher, TA, and other students in this class?\n  We use Slack for most class and one-on-one communication. Don\u0026rsquo;t email or direct message using I-Learn.\nA. Should I paste code snippets in our class Slack channel to get help? Yes.\nB. Should I ask questions about the projects and the readings in our class Slack channel? Yes.\nC. Should I post random quotes or videos in our class Slack channel? No. Use the #random channel. All assignments are submitted in I-Learn. A. Each project submission requires you to submit a short message to the teacher about your work.\nB. We will respond to your message with edits you can make to earn full credit on your resubmit.\nC. Class announcements about the grading of projects are posted in I-Learn.  Online reading materials  Python for Data Science: A port of R for Data Science using the Python packages pandas and Altair. pandas User Guide Altair User Guide Python Data Science Handbook SQL by data.world  Preparation In my experience, getting lectured training outside of college is even more expensive than it is in college. A week\u0026rsquo;s worth of training can cost more than a semester of school here at BYUI. Due to this expense, learning how to digest online material gain understanding before going to the expert with questions is a valuable skill to develop. I expect that you have completed the assigned reading material before class begins.\nSpecifications grading Grading is a nasty side effect of mass learning and academia. We are in a class at a university and will have to manage this side effect. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to let it control our learning, thinking, or this class. Learning and thinking should motivate each activity.\nAs we team, teacher and student, we have the challenge to become more! We have worked hard to identify the specifications needed for a python user of the pandas and Altair packages. Our goal is to align your grade with the skill specification you have mastered. In other words, the grade you want will determine how much work you will do. We will not score individual tasks in the class on a percentage scale. If your work meets the specified criteria, you will get full credit.\nIn a specifications-grading system, all tasks are evaluated on a high-standards pass\/fail basis using detailed checklists of task requirements and expectations4. You earn your letter grade by earning passing marks on a set of tasks. This system provides various choices and is closer to how learning and work occur in the real world. It will be easy for us to tell if work is complete, done in good faith, and consistent with the requirements.\nGrading Scale and Elements The grading scale describes the amount of work you must put into the grading elements to achieve the your desired grade. The grading scale only lists requirements for A, B, C, and D. You can request half-step adjustments if you fall slightly short or over on some elements.\nYou will need to provide a detailed description of your completed grading elements in your Review and Request Letter (due at the end of the semester) to support your grade request. For example, if a student was in the B range they might write the following:\n\u0026ldquo;I got three fives, one four, and two threes for 29 points on the projects. I met the checkpoint requirements with 4 halfway checkpoints and 4 full-mark methods checkpoints. I regularly attended data science society. I believe my coding challenge will be above a 3. I request a B\u002b.\u0026quot;\n  Leader (A)    Element Requirement Description     Projects 34 Points 5 points per project   Mid-project checkpoints 5 completed Full credit   Methods \u0026amp; Calculations checkpoints 6 completed 100% unlimited attempts   DS Community Complete 2 \u0026ndash;   Request and review letter submission \u0026ndash;   Coding challenge At least 3 Score is out of 4    See the competency descriptions in the next section.

You can request half-step adjustments if you fall slightly short or over on some elements.\n   Competency elements  Projects (Grand questions) Each of the seven projects is worth 5 points and you get one additional submission after the due date. There are 5 two-week projects and two one-week projects to start and end the class.\nGrading Details  1 point: Submission 3 points: submission of a good faith attempt with a statement of work quality. 4 points: High-quality work that addresses each of the Grand Questions and a statement of work quality. 5 points: Addressed reviewer issues and completion of resubmission if needed.   Checkpoints (methods and calculations) These checkpoints are in Canvas and they open when the project starts. They have unlimited attempts and remain open until the end of the semester.\nExamples  Fact-Finding Questions (Calculate descriptive summaries): Fact-finding questions help you with calculations that build into the Grand Questions of the project. These questions have clearly defined answers using Python calculations. You should expect 2-3 problems.   Example: Using the top 10 airports in size, what is the average size? Example: What proportion of flights are delayed at the largest airport?   How the code works questions (Explaining the tools): This part could have direct answer questions or open-ended questions.   Example (direct): What is the recommended function for arranging your data by a variable? What are the outputs after using \u0026lt;FUNCTION\u0026gt;? Example (open): Your client has shown some confusion about NumPy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;nan\u0026rsquo; handling in Python. Help them understand by answering the question, \u0026lsquo;How is missing data handled in Pandas?\u0026rsquo;   Checkpoints (Mid-project status) The mid-project checkpoint has a few questions. It opens the first day of the project and closes at 1 am on the 3rd day of class for the project. It has the following questions.\nExamples  Have you checked off more than one grand question from the current project? (Yes\/No) Have you spent at least 2 hours using code to tackle problems related to the case study? (Yes\/No). Have you prepared questions you have about the case study to ask in your next meeting? (Yes\/No).   Data science community To earn credit for the DS Community element you must complete two different tasks from the list below. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to report on which tasks you completed and what you learned from them.\n Attend Data Science Society at least once. Sign up for an email newsletter that will teach you more about data science. Data Science Weekly or Data Elixir are good options. Listen to a podcast episode about data science. Build a Career in Data Science has some excellent episodes. Watch a professional presentation on YouTube about data science. Be prepared to share the link and a summary of the video. Reach out to someone who works in a data-related field and ask them for 15 minutes of their time. Use this time to conduct an \u0026ldquo;informational interview\u0026rdquo; and learn more about their responsibilities and career path. Research and apply to at least 5 data-related jobs or internships.   Finishing the semester Submit a request and review letter that includes what you have learned from this class, the next data science course you plan on taking, and the final grade that you are requesting based on the work you have submitted.\n Coding challenge We will have an in-class coding challenge on the ultimate or penultimate day of class. It would be best if you did not view this challenge like a traditional exam. It will cover the general techniques that we have been practicing throughout the course.\nWe expect to have a few practice challenges throughout the semester. We will score the coding challenge on a four-point scale.\n 1 point: At least you tried. 2 points: You have learned some items from the course, but your work in the coding challenge is deficient. 3 points: Your submission uses proper coding techniques and addresses the objective. 4 points: Exceptional work. Your code can be used as a solution to share with others.       https:\/\/medium.com\/@nikhilbd\/what-makes-a-good-data-scientist-engineer-a8b4d7948a86#.jr80wl98y. I suppose some of you are just taking this class because your degree says you can, and it fits in your schedule. If so, we should chat to make sure this is the right class for you. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https:\/\/arxiv.org\/ftp\/arxiv\/papers\/1612\/1612.07140.pdf. You will see this pattern in DS 350, DS 460, and Math 488. It will progressively get more realistic. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n We do expect that this is not your first experience with Python and VS Code. If you have done other programming courses, you should be able to succeed in this course. If you have any questions, please ask. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Making the right checklists can be difficult. Bad checklists could fall in the following categories \u0026ndash; vague and imprecise; too long; hard to use; impractical; too pedantic. Useful checklists are precise, efficient, easy to use and understand. This is the first time this course has been offered, so we will have to work together to ensure the requirements are reasonable. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   </p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/course-materials\/syllabus\/"},{value:"Introduction",label:"<p>A competent student should be able to finish the exercises within 60 minutes. You should work through it on your own. This serves as an assessment of your understanding of the assigned readings.\nBefore you start Make sure you have installed VS-code, pandas, and altair on your computer. You can install these package by typing this line in the terminal.\npip install pandas altair\nOR if you have more than one version of python\npip3.9 install pandas altair\npip3.9 indicates the version of python you are installing the packages to.\nPart 1 Get familiar with your tools Programming involves a lot of research. Unlike subjects like Mathematics or History, we are not required to remember every single function and its usage. It is natural for experienced programmers to look for answers on the internet, books, even from other people\u0026rsquo;s code. Programming will be extremely frustrating if we are not allowed to do web searches, so please get familiar with the tools you have and use them often.\nOffical Documentation This should be your first resort for understanding any code\/function. Scanning the documentation of a function will allow you to get an overview of its usage.\nHere is a link to the documentation of the assign() function:\n(https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/docs\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)\nExample of assign() (as shown in the documentation)\nimport pandas as pd df1 = pd.DataFrame({\u0026#39;temp_c\u0026#39;: [17.0, 25.0]}, index=[\u0026#39;Portland\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Berkeley\u0026#39;]) df2 = df1.assign(temp_f=df1.temp_c * 9 \/ 5 \u002b 32) Exercise 1: After reading the documentation for assign(), write a short paragraph to explain assign() as if you were talking to someone with zero programming experience (use the example above to help you explain assign()).\n What is the difference between df1 and df2? How was df2 derived from df1?)  Online textbook It pains us to see students would rather be stuck at problems for hours yet they refuse to use the textbook. This is another very useful resource since this is designed for this class. link to the textbook: (https:\/\/byuidatascience.github.io\/python4ds\/)\nExercise 2: Locate the section where the textbook talks about query() and answer these questions.\n What function in R\u0026rsquo;s dplyr is equivalent or comparable to query() in pandas (You should include the section number in your answer)? What is the easiest mistake for python beginner to make that was shown in the text about query() (You should include the section number in your answer)?  The internet Google is a programmer\u0026rsquo;s friend. Get used to googling thing, in fact, you want to be an expert in googling\n Question that cannot be answered by the textbook and documentation? Google it. A function you have never seen before? Google it. An error in your code? Google it.  Exercise 3: Provide at least 2 extra resources you could find about the pandas function drop() on the internet.\nTutor, TA (Through slack, zoom, or in-person) We want to help you with your work; we want to answer your questions; but most importantly, we want to help you succeed in this class. That will require you to put in the necessary time in understanding the readings, coding and debugging. When you ask us a question, we expect that you have read the documentation, searched the textbook, and done your own research. Then we can be most helpful and can provide insights on top of your understanding.\nExamples of bad questions  How does drop() work? We will ask you to read the documentation for drop(). How do you make a table in a markdown file? We will refer you to the textbook. I don\u0026rsquo;t want these columns in my data, how can I drop them? We will ask you if you have found any things on the internet.  Examples of good questions  I am still confused about the syntax of drop(). After reading the documentation, this is my understanding of the function\u0026hellip; . What am I missing? I tried making a table in markdown (show code), it is still not giving me what I want, how can I fix this? I am trying to drop these columns in my dataframe, I think drop() is what I am looking for. Am I in the right direction? If not, what keywords should I be googling?  Exercise 4:\nUsing the code and tools mentioned above, finish question 4 and 5 under 3.2.4 in the textbook.(use the data in mpg for your plot):\n# library import import pandas as pd import altair as alt # data import url = \u0026quot;https:\/\/github.com\/byuidatascience\/data4python4ds\/raw\/master\/data-raw\/mpg\/mpg.csv\u0026quot; mpg = pd.read_csv(url)   Question 4: Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.\n  Question 5: What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n  After you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script    See the script.   </p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/skill_builders\/introduction\/"},{value:"Project 0: Introduction",label:"<p>Background We will complete six projects during the semester that each take about four days of class. On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n Python and VS Code are tools commonly used in the field of data science. During our first two days of class we will get VS Code prepped for data science programming. Completing Project 0 will set you pu for success the rest of the semester.\nData Every data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have \u0026lsquo;Download\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Information\u0026rsquo; links like the ones below.\n Download: mpg data\nInformation: Data description\nReadings The Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.\nWe recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding before the first day of each project. You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.\n The readings listed below are required for the first two days of class.\n Python for Data Science (P4DS): Introduction P4DS: Data Visualization Section 3.1 \u0026amp; 3.2 Only  Optional References  VS Code user interface Reading Technical Documentation  Questions and Tasks: This section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a rport and submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.\n  Finish the readings and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online) In VS Code, write a python script to create the example Altair chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you have to type chart to see the Altair chart after you create it. Your final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).  print(mpg .head(5) .filter([\u0026#34;manufacturer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;year\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hwy\u0026#34;]) .to_markdown(index=False)) Deliverables: Deliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”.

What is a data scientist?    Brother Hathaway\u0026rsquo;s definition:\n A blend of programmer, statistician, and communicator that burns with curiosity.\n My definiton for DS 250:\n Someone who can extract insights from data and then communicate those insights with clarity.\n Learn more about the BYU-Idaho data science program here.\n   What is data science programming?    Data scientists write code as a means to an end, whereas software developers write code to build things. Data science is inherently different from software development in that data science is an analytic activity, whereas software development has much more in common with traditional engineering.\nData scientists tackle problems such as identifying fraudulent transactions, or predicting which employees are likely to leave a company. Software developers can take the data scientists models and turn them into fully functioning systems with production-quality code. Software developers tackle problems like getting an algorithm to run more efficiently, or building user interfaces.\n   Course Outcomes    Upon completing this course, you will be able to use data-driven programming in Python to handle, format, and visualize data. We will introduce you to data wrangling techniques (panadas), analytical methods (scikit-learn), and the grammar of graphics (Altair). Specifically, as a successful learner, you will be able to:\n Use functions, data structures, and other programming constructs efficiently to process and find meaning in data. Programmatically load data from various types of data sources, including files, databases, and remote services. Use data manipulation libraries to perform straightforward analysis, produce charts, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms. Use machine learning libraries to discover insights, make predictions, and interpret the success of these algorithms. Collaborate and share your work with industry-leading tools.     BYU-Idaho Mission Statement     Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.\n  How would you describe a leader? What makes a leader powerful? What does a leader do with insights?  An example of a good leader.\nWhat (or who) is truth?\n   ## Course Format and Grading How hard is this class going to be?    The reality of CSE 250:\n We have done all we can to ensure that this is a 2-credit course for the average student. That means that we expect 4-6 hours outside of class for the average student to achieve an A. You have to put in the time if you want to build skills. The course is necessarily creative in nature. That fact usually makes it feel more challenging. We will be asking you to learn to write creative data science python code. If you have any concerns, please talk with me!     What is the structure of CSE 250?    The class uses 7 projects to teach data science programming in Python using pandas, Altair, scikit-learn, and numpy.\n Projects Syllabus     How do I get the grade I want?

DS programming requires a lot of data wrangling. Using the proper functions, we can create concise and comprehensive codes. You should be exposed to a few functions through the readings this week.\nYou may want to at least scan the readings before beginning this task since this serves as an assessment of your understanding of the assigned readings. A prepared student should be able to finish the exercises within 60 minutes. You should work through it on your own.\nBefore you start Make sure you have installed VS-code, pandas, and Altair on your computer. You can install these packages by typing this line in the terminal:\npip install pandas altair\nOR if you have more than one version of python:\npip3.9 install pandas altair\npip3.9 indicates the version of python you are installing the packages to.\nData import Run the following code to import the data we need for this skill builder:\n# package import import numpy as np import pandas as pd import altair as al # data import dat = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;https:\/\/vincentarelbundock.github.io\/Rdatasets\/csv\/AER\/Guns.csv\u0026#34;) Make sure the variable dat is correctly assigned in your environment and finish the following exercises. You can read the documentation of the data on this page - https:\/\/vincentarelbundock.github.io\/Rdatasets\/doc\/AER\/Guns.html\nExercise 1 One of the first things we can do to a freshly imported data is to check its columns. This will help us understand the basic structure of the dataframe(table).\n Using one line of code, select all the columns in dat, assign it to a variable called col_list.\n  Hint Every dataframe has an attribute \u0022columns\u0022. Accessing this attribute will give you a list of all column names  We often want to know the dimension of a dataframe. How many columns are in the dataset? How many rows are in the dataset?\n Using one line of code, show the number of columns and rows in dat.\n  Hint Every dataframe has an attribute \u0022shape\u0022. Accessing this attribute will give you the dimension of a datafarme  Now run dat.head(). It will print out the first 5 rows of data in dat.\n Just from looking at the output, what column(s) seems to be redundant with the row number?\n  Hint There is one column that serves as nothing but a row counter, that columns is redundant.  Exercise 2 After a brief investigation of the data, we will clean up the data. By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down dat so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n Using one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n  Hint Use `drop()`. Understand what \u0026ldquo;axis\u0026rdquo; is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndat.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the \u0026ldquo;_\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;s with the correct values and assign the output to dat.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the changes in dat. Run dat.head() to make sure the column is dropped in dat.\nExercise 3 We have filtered dat vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter dat horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to dat. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True\/False. For example, 8 \u0026gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n what is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n exp1 = 8 \u0026gt; 5 exp2 = dat.violent \u0026lt; 300  Hint Try type() on else variable OR calling else variable.  Run ths code below:\n By putting dat.violent \u0026lt; 300, and the violent column from dat into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n exp = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;dat.violent \u0026lt; 300\u0026quot; : exp2, \u0026quot;violent value from dat\u0026quot; : dat.violent}) exp  Hint Try computing `dat.violent[n]  Using query(), filter down the dat so that it only contains the data for idaho\n  Hint query() takes in expressions and filters down data.  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the changes in dat. Run dat.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\nExercise 4 Besides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it. By adding a new column to the data, we assign a new value to each row.\n Using assign(), create a new column that show the ratio between murder rate and violent rate.\n  Hint Use assign() You see get the ratio by computing this code:\ndat.murder\/dat.violent\n Exercise 5  Create a scatter plot that shows the relationship between murder rate and violent rate for the state of Idaho. Your chart should show murder rate as the x-axis, violent as the y-axis.\n  Hint Can you mimic this plot? (https:\/\/altair-viz.github.io\/gallery\/scatter_tooltips.html)\n  For an extra push Exercise 6  Using a line of code, filter down the data set so that it only shows the data in years between 1993 and 1997.\n Exercise 7  Create a line chart that show prisoners numbers for the state of Idaho, Utah, and Oregon.\n Your chart should show year as the x-axis, prisoner as the y-axis, states as different colours, along with an appropriate title.\nExercise 8  Without using query(), finshed the data wrangling in question 2,5 and 6.\n After you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script    See the script.   </p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/skill_builders\/pandas_altair\/"},{value:"Project 1: What\u0027s in a name?",label:"<p>Background Early in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used again and again until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.\nWith the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.\nBy the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native.

Arriving hours late may result in you missing a connecting flight, job interview, or your best friend’s wedding.\nIn 2003 the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) began collecting data on the causes of delayed flights.

Questions and Tasks   Which airport has the worst delays? Discuss the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.\n  What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Discuss the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)\n  According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:__\n 100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather  30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather. From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%.    Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Discuss what you learn from this graph.\n  Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the \u0026ldquo;NaN\u0026rdquo; for at least one missing value.__\n  Deliverables Use this template to submit your Client Report.

The following four articles cover some of the most common definitions.\nAs you read them, think about the differences and similarities of the definitions. Given the backgrounds of the various authors, whose opinions might you give more weight to?\n Michael Copeland writing for NVidia Bernard Marr writing for Forbes Vincent Granville writing for Data Science Central Simply Statistics Blog - The key word in \u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; is not Data, it is Science  Of particular note is this quote from the Granville article:\n Earlier in my career (circa 1990) I worked on image remote sensing technology, among other things to identify patterns (or shapes or features, for instance lakes) in satellite images and to perform image segmentation: at that time my research was labeled as computational statistics, but the people doing the exact same thing in the computer science department next door in my home university, called their research artificial intelligence. Today, it would be called data science or artificial intelligence, the sub-domains being signal processing, computer vision or IoT.\n As with most things in the realm of science, there tends to be a wide gap between how the media, government, and business sectors view a particular technology compared to how it\u0026rsquo;s viewed by the engineers and scientists using that technology.\nFor our purposes in this course, we\u0026rsquo;ll define these terms as follows:\n Artificial Intelligence: The study of man-made \u0026ldquo;agents\u0026rdquo; that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of success at some goal.1\nMachine Learning: A subfield within Artificial Intelligence that gives \u0026ldquo;computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\u0026quot;2\nData Science: The study and use of the techniques, statistics, algorithms, and tools needed to extract knowledge and insights from data.3\n MORAVEC\u0026rsquo;S PARADOX In the 1980\u0026rsquo;s, Hans Moravec made the following observation, which came to be known as Moravec\u0026rsquo;s Paradox:\n \u0026hellip;as the number of demonstrations has mounted, it has become clear that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.4\n So, while AI and machine learning algorithms can accomplish many tasks much better than humans can, any toddler can outperform even the most state-of-the-art neural network in picking out photos of their parents or pet cat.\n5\nEven though Moravec wrote about this over thirty years ago, the same sentiment persists in AI research today. In a 2016 interview, Dr. Sean Holden an AI researcher at Cambridge University, discussed the differences between human intelligence and artificial intelligence:\n “Most AI researchers don’t try to solve the whole problem because it’s too hard. They take some specific problem and do it better. That’s not to say that the way humans think isn’t useful to AI, but working out how brains do things is hard. And there’s a difference in scale. Brains are doing things that are in some senses quite different from what AI researchers are currently attacking – I’d be ecstatic, for example, if I could build a robot that could put on a duvet cover.”6\n Dr. Fumiya Iida, from the Machine Intelligence Lab at Cambridge, adds:\n “We have hundreds of thousands of muscles in our body, so how can the brain control this? A computer can’t. Every fraction of a second you have to co-ordinate hundreds of muscles just to grab a cup, for example.”6\n PREDICTION VS. INFERENCE In machine learning, we are typically interested in doing one of two things: making inferences, or making predictions.\n Inference: Given a set of data you want to infer how the output is generated as a function of the data.\nPrediction: Given a new measurement, you want to use an existing data set to build a model that reliably chooses the correct identifier from a set of outcomes.7\n This example explains the differences between those two goals:\n Inference: You want to find out what the effect of Age, Passenger Class and, Gender has on surviving the Titanic Disaster. You can put up a logistic regression and infer the effect each passenger characteristic has on survival rates.\nPrediction: Given some information on a Titanic passenger, you want to choose from the set {lives,dies} and be correct as often as possible.7\n Classification Algorithms Imagine that you\u0026rsquo;re a big fan of comic books. Over the years, you\u0026rsquo;ve read enough Marvel and DC comics that if I asked you to \u0026ldquo;classify\u0026rdquo; which universe Superman belonged to, you\u0026rsquo;d be able to confidently say, \u0026ldquo;The DC Universe\u0026rdquo;.\nOr, let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;ve eaten a lot of chocolate in your life. If I were to have you close your eyes and take a bite of chocolate, you might be able to accurately tell me if it was white chocolate, milk chocolate, semi-sweet, or dark.\nThese are both classification problems. Based on your prior knowledge or training regarding different groups, you can take an item and sort it into the correct group.\nIn machine learning, classification algorithms, (or classifiers), need to be trained before they can classify things on their own. We can train an algorithm by providing it with lots of examples from each group and telling it which attributes of those samples are important. The more examples we use to train our algorithm, the more accurate the classification of new items will be.\nIn the example below, we’re telling the algorithm “this is what a blue circle looks like\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;this is what a green circle looks like\u0026rdquo;, etc\u0026hellip;\nOnce an algorithm has been trained, we can see how well it performs by providing it with test data consisting of new items it hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen yet, and checking to see if it can correctly predict which group the new items belong to.\nThe Iris Dataset ABOUT THE DATA For this example, we will use Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Iris Data.\nThe Iris dataset contains the length and width of the sepals and petals from 150 iris flowers across three different species of iris: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.\nEach row in the Iris dataset represents the measurements of a single flower. We refer to each of these as a sample, observation, or instance.\nEach column in the Iris dataset represents a particular thing being measured about each flower. From left to right we have (in centimeters) the sepal length, the sepal width, the petal length, and the petal width. Each of these is referred to as a feature, attribute, measurement, or dimension.\nThe final column in the dataset is the species of the flower. This final column is often referred to as the target or class of the sample.\nClassifiers Classifier algorithms generally follow the same set of steps. Our goal is to create a classifier that can be provided with the measurements of petals and sepals, and then use that information to predict the species of iris flower we\u0026rsquo;re measuring.\nLoad data The first thing we need to do is load our data. In most cases, there is some pre-processing that has to be done on the data in order to get it to the point where we can start working with it. Often you will need to normalize and encode variables.\n Normalization reading Encoding reading  In this case however, the data is provided to you in the exact format you need:\n sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 Iris-setosa 1 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 Iris-setosa 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 Iris-setosa 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 Iris-setosa 4 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 Iris-setosa .. ... ... ... ... ... 145 6.7 3.0 5.2 2.3 Iris-virginica 146 6.3 2.5 5.0 1.9 Iris-virginica 147 6.5 3.0 5.2 2.0 Iris-virginica 148 6.2 3.4 5.4 2.3 Iris-virginica 149 5.9 3.0 5.1 1.8 Iris-virginica The csv file for the iris data can be found here. There are many ways to load data from a csv file, but one handy way is to use the read_csv function from the Pandas library:\nimport pandas as pd url = \u0026quot;https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Course\/skill_builders\/ml_sklearn\/machine_learning.csv\u0026quot; data = pd.read_csv(url) Split data Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll randomly divide all of the samples into two groups. The first group will consist of our training data, or the samples we\u0026rsquo;ll use to train our classifier. The second group will consist of our test data, the data we\u0026rsquo;ll use to test our classifier.\nThere are many ways to do this, but if have our features (sepal and petal measurements) and targets (species names) in separate arrays, we can use the train_test_split function of the sklearn library to do this for us:\nNote, that if you use pandas to load the csv file, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the data in a single pandas Data Frame. At some point you\u0026rsquo;ll need to split that data frame into two numpy arrays, one containing the features, and the other containing the targets.\nTake a look at the Indexing and Selecting Data page in the Pandas user guide for more details and splitting the data, and the to_numpy function for converting to a numpy array.\nNotice the transformation can be completed before the data is divided into test and training sets. Two numpy arrays can be passed to the train_test_split function to get two sets of arrays back. Alternatively, the data frame can be passed to the test_train_split, and then the test and training data is split into their feature and target components.\nThe following examples assume you\u0026rsquo;ve split the data into features and targets before passing it to test_train_split.\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # features = ... select the feature columns from the data frame # targets = ... select the target column from the data frame # Randomize and split the samples into two groups. # 30% of the samples will be used for testing. # The other 70% will be used for training. train_data, test_data, train_targets, test_targets = train_test_split(features, targets, test_size=.3) You could also use python\u0026rsquo;s built in libraries to randomly shuffle the data, and then use array slicing to split the data into test and training subsets. However if you do, make sure you do it in such a way that you still know which species goes with each set of measurements.\nTrain classifier By providing the algorithm with training data, we allow it to create relationships between the features of a sample and its class. In the case of the Iris data set, we\u0026rsquo;re training our algorithm on how a given set of sepal and petal measurements correlate to the flower\u0026rsquo;s species.\nsklearn has a classifier called GaussianNB which we can use to demonstrate this. GaussianNB is a \u0026ldquo;Naïve Bayes\u0026rdquo; classifier that assumes two things about our data:\n  That the underlying features follow a continuous, normal distribution. (The Gaussian part) That each feature is statistically independent of every other feature. (The Naïve part)   Do you think both of these assumptions are true for the Iris data?\nTo train our classifier, first we create an instance of it, then we use the fit method to teach it about our data:\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB classifier = GaussianNB() classifier.fit(train_data, train_targets) Test classifier Now that our classifier has been trained on how to classify iris flowers, it\u0026rsquo;s time to test it to see if it can correctly predict the species of flower from a set of measurements.\nNote that it\u0026rsquo;s very important when testing our algorithm that we only test it on data that was not used to train it. Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;re only testing it\u0026rsquo;s ability to remember training data. This is why we split the data into two groups.\nTo test our classifier, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the predict method and provide it with our test data. This method will return a list of predicted targets, one for each sample in the test data.\nIn our case, we\u0026rsquo;ll give it a list of petal and sepal measurements it has never seen before, and it will return a list of species predictions, on prediction for each sample in our test data:\ntargets_predicted = classifier.predict(test_data) Assess classifier performance Since we already know which type of iris each sample in the test data corresponds to, we can compare the predictions made by the classifier to the sample\u0026rsquo;s actual species and calculate how well our algorithm performs.\nIf m is the number of correct predictions made, and n is the total number of samples in our test data, then accuracy can be calculated as:\naccuracy = m\/n\nSo if our test data has 20 samples and the classifier predicts the correct flower species for 15 of them, then we would say our algorithm has an accuracy of 75%.\n(Note that accuracy isn\u0026rsquo;t the best metric to use for evaluating classification algorithms. We\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at a few alternatives in the future.)\nSummary To summarize: we take our dataset and divide it in two parts: training data and test data. We use the training data to train the classifier to make classifications, then we use the test data to test how well our classifier performs.\nIf we have a classifier that performs well, we can use it with new data, samples whose groups we don\u0026rsquo;t know ahead of time, and the accuracy metric will give us some idea of how reliable those predictions are.\nIf our classifier performs poorly, we either need to provide it with more training data, modify or replace it, or select a different set of attributes to use as features.\nCSE 450: Machine Learning \u0026amp; Data Mining is the class were you can build depth in Machine Learning and it\u0026rsquo;s applications.\nREFERENCES   Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig (Prentice Hall, 2009).↩ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers, by Arthur L.

A relational database consists of tables\/data sets that share columns. These shared columns then establish the relationship between the tables, thus the name relational database. The relations are sometimes not easily found and they require careful investigations.\nTo understand what is in a relational database, we can start with understanding the tables and the columns within.\nHere is a link to the readme file of the baseball database.\n What is the name of the table that records data about pitchers in the regular seasons?\n  What do the HR and HBP columns mean in that table respectively?\n Excercise 2 SELECT and FROM The simplest SQL query is a query with SELECT and FROM. These are the keywords you will see again and again in SQL. Usually, when constructing a more complex query, it is easier to identify what goes into these two clauses first.\n Create a query that shows all columns from the table you found in Exercise 1, save the dataframe in a variable \u0026ldquo;pitch\u0026rdquo;\n You script should look something like:\nresult = pd.read_sql_query( \u0027SELECT _______ FROM _______\u0027, con) results Excercise 2 WHERE The WHERE keyword allows us to filter down the table horizontally (fewer rows).\nIt goes after SELECT and FROM.\n Using a SQL query, select all rows in the same table where HR is lesser than 10 and gs is greater than 25.\n  Find out what the columns mean and explain your query in words\n Excercise 3 ORDER BY ORDER BY sort the table you select by one or more columns and goes after WHERE\n Using the same query in exercise 2, edit it so that the table is ordered by the year of the season(nearest to furthermost) and the player ID(alphabetically).\n Excercise 4 Joins Joins are used when you wish to create a new table through two different tables.

This skill builder attempts to keep things basic and simple. With that being said, there are some terms that are important to understand.

We will be using an IMDB Ratings dataset. It contains columns that are categorical. Sklearn cannot handle columns that are strings, so we need to convert these into a numerical representation. We accomplish this by either one hot encoding, label encoding, or taking just one value of the range provided. There are many other ways to represent these columns as numbers, but they are beyond the scope of this course.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve converted all columns to numeric, in an intelligent way, you will be asked to recreate a graph using altair.

Make sure the data type of this new column is numeric!!   Remove the box_office_rev column from the dataset.  The .str.split() and .astype() methods might be of use! Also, to get the euro sign just copy it from here, €, and put it in your code.\nThe first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe should look like this\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration major_hit high_range_rev     9.3 R Crime 142 no 2345444803   9.2 R Crime 175 no 2182412593   9.1 R Crime 200 no 1604872807   9 PG-13 Action 152 no 284317976   8.9 R Crime 154 yes 1791932201     Exercise 1 Convert the major_hit column to 1\/0\u0026rsquo;s. yes -\u0026gt; 1 and no -\u0026gt; 0.

We\u0026rsquo;re using label encoding in this case because the movie ratings already have a natural ordering to them. We will replace each rating with a number in it\u0026rsquo;s natural ascending order.\nTo be more specific, here is how we will do it.\n G: 0 PG: 1 PG-13: 2 R: 3  A dictionary and the .map() method could be useful for this exercise. There are other ways of tackling this problem though. Be creative!\nThe first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe should look like\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration major_hit high_range_rev     9.3 3 Crime 142 0 1925521976   9.2 3 Crime 175 0 178034987   9.1 3 Crime 200 0 2618541398   9 2 Action 152 0 997115723   8.9 3 Crime 154 0 1173054364     Exercise 3 The last column that we need to take care of is genre.

It is a declarative visualization package in Python that is based on Vega-Lite which leverages the grammar of graphics.\n User Guide Data Visualization Curriculum or the Quarto version https:\/\/jjallaire.github.io\/visualization-curriculum\/) P4DS Data Visualization Chapter  Rendering Altair Charts in Quarto We use Quarto to render Altair images automagically into our HTML reports. The process should simply work.\nHowever, read in the following section IF you need to export one of your images as a .png or another image format. Saving Altair Charts Just installing altair and altair_saver will not allow you to leverage the .save() method to save your chart. The javascript visualization you see in your interactive python window needs additional external applications to allow .save(\u0027chart.png\u0027) to work.\nWe will go through a few ways for us to save our Altair plots.\n  1. Saving altair plots programmatically Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to save the above plot as a PNG file. Assuming we have already installed the altair library, we need to install the altair_saver.\n1.1 Installing the altair_saver Within your interactive python window execute the following command.\nimport sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install altair_saver 1.2 Additional tool for saving plots We suggest NodeJS path. However, you are more than welcome to study Selenium for further understanding. The Github repository for altair_saver, the developers exclusively told us to install additional tools.\nNodeJS Installation\n Install the NodeJS for your platform Run the following in your Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows) to install all the packages we need from NodeJS.  npm install -g vega-lite vega-cli canvas M1 Mac Altair Solution  Install selenium using the chromedriver package form this link: https:\/\/chromedriver.chromium.org. Unzip the file and move the file to your chrome path \/usr\/local\/bin\/chromedriver  See the selenium_fix.py script for an example.\nNote: This process will run a local server on your computer that opens the chart as an PNG file in chrome and downloads the file to the folder in which that VSCode file is located on your computer.\n1.3 Saving a plot using altair_saver It might require you to restart VScode and import everything again for this to work. Please note that the plot will be saved in the same folder of the script.\nchart = alt.chart(\u0026lt;data\u0026gt;).\u0026lt;chart_methods\u0026gt; chart.save(\u0026#39;name_of_chart.png\u0026#39;) 2. Save as PNG method The method only requires us to have Altair library. Whenever we output a plot, we will see a button with three dots at the top right corner of the plot.\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n3. Screenshot method If all thing fails and we need to save a plot, the snip \u0026amp; sketch (Windows) or taking a screenshot (MacOS) will be our last resort.\n</p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/course-materials\/altair\/"},{value:"GitHub and git",label:"<p>Complete the Hello World GitHub Guide\n</p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/skill_builders\/git_github\/"},{value:"Markdown for DS",label:"<p>Markdown Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing more accessible.

Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project\u0026rsquo;s source code history, while GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool. Git is a tool a developer installs locally on their computer, while GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.1\nGit? The Git tool is popular with developers because is stays true to its purpose of versioning source code, managing commit histories and making it possible to share code between developers without deviating into peripheral fields. There is no feature bloat with Git. It does what it does, it does nothing else, and it makes no apologies for that fact.1\nGithub? We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special?

Most likely, you have had 1-2 courses of programming before you have taken CSE 250. Unlike traditional computer science courses, CSE 250 uses Python in an interactive mode instead of building programs. The data provider usually has some big questions that need answering; However, there are hundreds of little issues and responses along the way. We use programming to facilitate this investigation.\nThere are similarities with User Experience Designers. In our case, we don\u0026rsquo;t get to ask users about their experience. We use programming to ask data about its background, and each data set has its own history. We want our analysis to mold to that experience. You can think of data science programming like a first date with your data. You can\u0026rsquo;t write one long program nieve of the issues and nuances each living data set provides.\n   How does CSE 250 compare to CSE 350 or Math 335?    The two courses have similarities. You could think of CSE 250 as an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. Both classes use real-world data and are built around data science projects. There are some critical differences between the two courses.\n In this course, we use Python, and CSE 350 uses R. We are introducing the principles of data science programming in CSE 250. The course is only 2-credits. CSE 250 is intended to introduce visualization, wrangling, and modeling.     How does CSE 250 prepare me for CSE 350, Math 335 and CSE 450?    You will be comfortable with interactive programming and have an introduction to the principles of data formats for data science applications. You will be introduced to principles related to machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualization.   What programming languages do we use in this course?    The course is done using Python. We focus on the pandas and Altair packages.   What are the prerequisites for this course?    Using the new courses at BYU-I, the prerequisite is CSE 110. However, if you have experience programming from other classes, you most likely are prepared for this course.   Why Python instead of R?    The computer science and software engineering programs at BYU-I use Python as their foundational courses. The standard student will have some experience with Python before CSE 250. Python is an essential programming language for data scientists, and we already have CSE 350\/Math 335, which is taught in R.   What is pandas?    pandas is the foundational data science package in Python. If you are using tabular data you will be in pandas.   Why are we using Altair instead of Seaborn or Matplotlib?    Matplotlib was the first visualization package to gain a following in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Many data scientists use both in their work—neither leverage the grammar of graphics as developed by Leland Wilkinson. Altair is built on Vega-Lite, which uses the Vega visualization grammar. It is declarative and actively developed. We expect that it will become the predominant visualization package in Python (https:\/\/youtu.be\/FytuB8nFHPQ and https:\/\/youtu.be\/vTingdk_pVM).   </p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/faq\/"},{value:"Projects",label:"<p>We will be relying on a few resources for this course.

Here are a few essential items.\n Your goal is to demonstrate your data science coding abilities. Get through as many items with a rough implementation as possible. Get your code to match our outputs as close as possible, but don\u0026rsquo;t stress over minute details. Keep most of the code you type. If you end up not using specific parts, comment them out and include them at the bottom. Use the entire hour and may not finish. Submit a .md and a .pdf report with your output and code for each challenge.  Please use the challenge template to submit your work.\nimport pandas as pd import altair as alt import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn import tree from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn import metrics Challenge 1 Split Entry houses are a failed building experiment in the United States.
