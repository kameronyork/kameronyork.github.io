Instructions for collection General Conference data after a new Conference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Copying the Data in Excel
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step is manual.  Open the Conference on the Church's website, then
open the excel file in this folder.  You will first copy the names in the 
left sidebar to add the speakers.  (OPTIONALLY you could run the "find-hyperlinks.py" file in this folder to return the URLs for each talk.  Remember, that script will include sustainings and auditing reports which should not be kept in the dataset files). Then input the titles.  Then go talk by talk copying the text and footnotes and clicking the buttons to add them to
the table.  Once this is complete, add this data to the "general-Conference
-talks.csv" file in the datasets folder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Creating the talk URLs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scraping the references for the Gospel Buddy extension needs the URLs for 
each talk.  Next you should copy and paste the talk speaker, title, and 
session information to the "conference-talk-hyperlinks.csv" file in the 
datasets folder.  Then go and find the URLs for each talk and copy them 
There.  OPTIONALLY you could run the "find-hyperlinks.py" file in this 
folder to return the URLs for each talk.  Remember, that script will 
include sustainings and auditing reports which should not be kept in the 
dataset files.  Once the dataset files are updated, publish to GitHub.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Generating Gospel Buddy References
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the new talk hyperlinks are added to the hyperlinks dataset file you 
can run the "webscrape-footnotes.py" script located in this folder. This 
python script will scrape all hyperlinks it finds in the body and reference
tabs of every conference talk in the hyperlinks dataset.  The script should
be run on all talks periodically instead of just new talks.  This will 
ensure ALL gospel buddy references are correct in case the Church updates
past talk footnotes.

The "webscrape-footnotes.py" file is designed to output four datasets in
JSON format to the datasets folder.  They have unique filters and purposes.

1. all-footnotes.JSON - This is the largest dataset as it contains all 
references from all talks.
2. all-foonotes-lookup.JSON - This dataset contains a unique list of all 
possible scriptures along with the number of times they appear in the 
all-footnotes.JSON file.
3. apostle-all-footnotes.json - Similar to the all-footnotes.JSON file, but
filtered to talks by apostles only.
4. apostle-all-footnotes-lookup.JSON - Similar to the all-footnotes-lookup
.json file, but counting the times they appear in the apostle-all-
footnotes.JSON file instead.

The files are the backbone of the Gospel Buddy extension.  Once they are 
completed and published to GitHub the extension will include the new data.
