<b>Points:</b> 
<br>
<br>
In this parable, unlike most, Jesus reveals the meaning.  Jesus is invited to eat with a Pharisee named Simon.  While having dinner, a "sinful" woman enters the house, cleans the savior's feet sith her tears, and annoints his feet wirh oil from an alabaster box.  Simon mutters, "Doesn't He know this woman is a sinner?", to which Jesus responds with this parable.
<br>
<br>
The meaning of the parable follows the telling.  After Simon rightly answers, Jesus says, "Simon, we've been having dinner for a while now and you haven't washed my feet or annointed my them with oil."  Then he applies the meaning of the parable to this scenario, "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much..." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/7?lang=eng&id=47#p47">Luke 7:47</a>).  An interesting phrase!  Because she has shown so much love, her sins are forgiven?  Does this mean as long as we show love to others we can sin as much as we want?  No, I believe the meaning is much deeper than the idea that, "loving others = forgiveness from sin."  
<br>
<br>
I find it interesting that the phrasing shown im verse 47 is effectively the reverse of the story in the parable.  In the parable the master forgives and the servant who owed most loves most.  However, in the real world application of verse 47, the Savior mentions her great love and then says her sins are forgiven. But, let's not allow this ordering to confuse us.  Think of this real world example on a grand scale.  This woman is washing and annointing the feet of the Messiah, the one who WILL forgive her sins.  She is performing this act of love because this man is her Savior.  Just like in the parable, Jesus has forgiven her of such a great amount.  An amount that has moved her to compassionate acts of service.
